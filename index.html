						Now I'm a junior at Iowa State University, studying software engineering. I've been lucky to have two internships, one at a startup and the other at a Fortune 500 company.

						I hope you'll <span class="orange">take a few minutes and look around</span> my site.

			<div class="text-small pad-bottom-large text-right">
				I've had two great internships that have helped me learn a lot about coding, teamwork, and life. But I think it is the jobs that I had before I wrote my first function that helped me succeed in my internships. I grew up working on a family farm, and above all I learned how to work hard, and to get the job done right.
			</div>
			<div class="text-small pad-bottom-large text-right">
				Prior to my freshman year at ISU I was also able to work for 3 years at a local orchard and at a summer camp doing maintenance. After my freshman year of college I interned at Sculpt, then after my sophomore year at Principal Financial Group. Just click/tap each logo for more information on my internships.

				Principal
			</div>
			<div class="text-small pad-bottom-large">
				At Principal Financial Group I was a front end developer intern on a front end specialty team. I worked on a few projects over the summer with another intern, and also helped out with smaller, regular tasks that my team had.
			</div>
			<div class="text-small pad-bottom-large">
				The first project I worked on was a discovery and recommendation project. The goal was to analyze a new technology, experiment with it, and decide if it could be used to fulfill a business need at Principal. The second project was an automation project, where we worked on optimizing a time consuming process. I got good experience with Node.js, Sails.js, HTML/CSS, jQuery, and PHP. I also got to work with Windows Batch programming, JSF, XSLT, and XML.
			</div>
			<div class="text-small pad-bottom-large">
				Principal also provided a cool experience by hosting a week long hackathon for all IT interns. The team I was on took first place. The hackathon was a blast, and taught me a lot about teamwork and leadership. Here's part of my mentor's review of me at the conclusion of my internship:

			</div>
			<div class="text-small pad-bottom-large text-right">
				Sculpt gave me a unique opportunity by letting me directly communicate with clients and make important decisions. I also gained invaluable connections in the Iowa startup and tech space because of Sculpt's active participation in that community. It's hard to describe everything I learned, but by the end of the summer I had no doubt in my mind what the best color in the world is. Here are a few words my boss, the CEO of Sculpt had to say about me:
			</div>
			<div class="text-medium pad-bottom-large text-quote text-right">
				"Just give him a blank canvas, a head-scratching problem, and a comfy place to rest his Macbook. With no more than that, he will make you money.<br><br>We had no open positions when Jason applied. He cold emailed me an offer, and we had no choice but to accept."

			</div>
			<div class="text-small pad-bottom-large text-left">
				I worked on Censure on a team with 3 other students for a class last spring. Censure is a web application that connects to the Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr APIs and uses them to grab all of a user's posts and run them through a censoring algorithm. There's an adjustable difficulty, and users can view all flagged posts and delete them directly from the app. It basically checks your social media for "bad posts".
			</div>
			<div class="text-small pad-bottom-large text-left">
				Censure was a lot of code, we learned a lot about connecting to APIs, and structuring a web application. If I could go back and rewrite Censure it would be a whole lot cleaner, but it took a lot of time from the 4 of us to finish before the end of the class.

				RLG (Rogue-Like-Game) was a game I made for another class last spring. I had never coded in C or C++ prior to the class, but by the end I had created a 5,300 line game. In the game you're a character in a dungeon, with monsters, items, stairs, all sorts of objects that manipulate gameplay. Despite this being a very time consuming and difficult project, it was a lot of fun being able to play the game after finishing it.

			</div>
			<div class="text-small pad-bottom-large text-left">
				Tumblfun was my main side-project during my freshman and sophomore year at Iowa State. I started massing Tumblr followers, and after about a year I had over 400,000 followers. I created Tumblfun to monetize them, and then opened my site out to other large Tumblr blogs to be used as an affiliate site. I optimized the site to make more money, using a responsive layout and improving page speed. Unfortunately, last year most of my blogs were terminated for some unknown reason. So I sold what blogs I had left, and the website. By the end of its short reign Tumblfun ammassed over 10,660,000 pageviews and generated over $36,700 in ad revenue.

				Unfortunately most of my blogs were terminated for some unknown reason last year. So I sold what blogs I had left, and the website. Now the site is pretty beat up and broken now (new owner hasn't updated it and doesn't use it anymore). But there are still some fun features that I implemented, including a quiz engine that still exists on the site.

				This website wasn't a one day project. I got a little picky with it, and eventually had to just get it together so I could use it this fall. I'm trying to do it with a high amount of original code, so things like the menu took a lot of time to get working. Some solid jQuery went into creating this site and my goal is to improve it much more when I have some time, and make it IE compatible, I guess.

				In addition to programming, I regularly use my social media and SEO skills in my own projects. Some examples include managing over $4,000 in social media ad spend for a startup, or the monetization of the over one million followers I've owned on social media. As a result I have a lot of good connections with people that have access to many millions of followers.

				There are numerous other projects I've worked on. A lot of the websites/applications I worked on during my internships I can't go into detail explaining (just playing it safe). At Sculpt I redesigned and modified multiple websites, and at Principal I did a bit more heavier programming (lots of Javascript). I also have done some freelance projects within the realm of basic Wordpress modifications (PHP and Javascript), for people who run sites similar to Tumblfun.
